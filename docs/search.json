    "text": "LinkedIn\n  \n  \n    \n     Email\n  \n\n\n\n\nWelcome to my website!\nGreetings!\nHello! My name is Gabrielle Davis, and I am currently a post-baccalaureate student at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). I have dedicated my academic journey to researching the intersection of obesity and cancer, with a particular focus on leveraging computational methods to enhance healthcare outcomes and overall efficiency.\nMy research spans a wide range of topics related to both obesity and cancer. This includes everything from organizing electronic health records for greater accessibility to exploring treatment methods that may be more effective in reducing cancer risk. Currently, my work focuses on helping individuals with type 2 diabetes identify medications that not only manage their diabetes but also reduce the risk of obesity-related cancers. In addition to my ongoing projects, I have also worked on research in agricultural and entomological fields.\nBeyond my role as a scholar, I am deeply committed to mentoring and teaching. Over the years, I have had the privilege of working with numerous students, helping guide them toward success. As a first-generation student, I understand the challenges that come with navigating academia, and I am passionate about supporting my peers, particularly in tackling the “weed-out” courses common in undergraduate studies. I frequently share tips on effective note-taking, ways to leverage individual strengths, and strategies for overcoming academic weaknesses. The path to becoming a doctor is no easy feat, but I thrive on collaborative opportunities that expand my knowledge while assisting my classmates along the way.\nThis website provides insight into my education, personal life, research projects, awards, and CV. You will also find details about my current work and the next steps in my academic career. I invite you to explore and learn more about my journey and the work that drives me.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."

    "text": "Globally, the Global Burden of Disease estimated more than 462 million people were affected by Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), a metabolic disorder, and projected the prevalence rate to increase from 6,059 T2D cases per 100,000 in 2017 to 7,079 per 100,000 in 2030. Effective management of T2D consists of insulin therapy and other anti diabetic (non-insulin) treatments prescribed by a healthcare professional. Currently, nearly one million deaths are attributed to T2D, and when left unmanaged, it contributes to elevated risks for diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and periodontal disease. The relationship between T2D and cancer is more complicated where previous publications report an elevated risk for liver and pancreas cancer and a decreased risk for breast and prostate cancer. The driver of these associations is unclear - T2D treatments or the disease. Here, we address a scientific gap quantifying strata-specific associations between T2D therapies and cancer risk by sex, self-reported race, and clinical-demographic factors (i.e. years of T2D, age of cancer onset, cancer stage, etc.). We hypothesize that T2D treatment profiles mediate cancer risk differently by cancer site, and more importantly by known cancer risk factors. We are developing a retrospective cohort using TriNetX, a real-world electronic health record database, to assess the correlation between T2D treatment profiles (insulin vs non-insulin) and cancer risk. In the United States, patients over the age of 18, diagnosed with T2D prior to the index period, and prescribed T2D medications during the index period (2005 -2018) are observed for a cancer outcome. The T2D prescription cohorts (e.g. insulin vs non-insulin) are propensity score matched (1:1) based on factors such as sex, self-reported race, and other demographic variables, and hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were computed to determine associations. Strata-specific results are presented. Our findings will determine the impact of T2D management on cancer risk across several risk strata and elucidate the scope of T2D therapy on individual cancer risk. Our analytical strategy to assess strata-specific effects will be used to inform cancer screening and prevention strategies for targeted at-risk populations and further advance the concept of personalized medicine."

During my time at PSU, I actively participated in various events and had the opportunity to meet a diverse group of people. Attending such a dynamic and opportunity-rich institution allowed me to explore numerous aspects of research, ultimately solidifying my passion for continued scholarly inquiry. This experience has inspired me to pursue a PhD and further advance my research career.\n\nCASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY\nCurrently, I am completing my time as a Case PREP Scholar at CWRU. This is a phenomenal opportunity that has allowed me to pursue biomedical science research. My current project focuses on the intersection between cancer and obesity and treatments that can potentially reduce an individual with diabetes risk of cancer. Click on the “projects” tab to learn more about the work I do on a daily basis!\n\nUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN:\nI am excited to announce I will be continuing my journey at University of Michigan. I am so excited, and I can’t wait to see the opportunities waiting for me. This second will be updated once I start my rotations and first week of classes!\nAnd of course, Go Blue!"

    "text": "Toxin Sequestration and Natural Predators of the Spotted Lantern Fly\n\n\n\nBanner Image\n\n\nThe rapid expansion of the invasive spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula, SLF) across the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states in the USA has markedly impacted the grape, forest, and ornamental industries, requiring a massive effort to decrease SLF populations and its economic impacts. The primary approach to manage SLF has been the use of synthetic insecticides, which can have negative effects on non-target arthropods, the environment, and humankind. Natural enemies such as predators could offer a safer management strategy. However, SLF sequester toxins from their preferred host, tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima, TOH), which can render these pests unpalatable to some types of predators. Using SLF reared on TOH or grapevines (an alternative preferred host), we conducted a study to determine if birds could distinguish between SLF that had fed on TOH vs. grape, and if so, would they show a preference for SLF fed on grape. We observed nest boxes used by several bird species to see if the birds would eat SLF provided in cups on top of the boxes, feed them to their young, or dispose of them (drop them on the ground). Then using the statistical package R, we compared birds’ behavior on the two different SLF diets using Chi-square tests. Although our research is not complete, we predict that birds will feed more on SLF that have not had access to TOH to their chicks than the SLF that had access to TOH. In our study, we will focus on the adult bird’s behavior, and observe if they consume the SLF, feed the SLF to their chicks, or discard the SLF. Watching the bird’s behavior will allow us to determine if they are natural predators against the SLF population."
